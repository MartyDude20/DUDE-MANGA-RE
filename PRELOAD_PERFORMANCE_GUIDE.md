## 🔄 How Preload System Works

### **1. Smart Background Preloading**
```python
# PreloadManager runs nightly at 2-6 AM
popular_searches = [
    'one piece', 'naruto', 'dragon ball', 'bleach',
    'attack on titan', 'my hero academia', 'demon slayer'
]

for search_term in popular_searches:
    # Scrape all sources in background
    results = scrape_all_sources(search_term)
    # Cache for 24 hours
    cache_results(search_term, results)
```

### **2. Intelligent Cache Strategy**
```python
# Cache Structure
search_cache = {
    'user_id': None,        # Global cache (shared by all users)
    'query_hash': 'md5("bleach")',
    'source': 'weebcentral',
    'results': [manga1, manga2, manga3...],
    'expires_at': '2024-01-15 06:00:00'
}
```

### **3. Instant Cache Lookup**
```python
def search_manga(query):
    # Check cache first (0.001 seconds)
    cached_results = cache_manager.get_cached_search(query, source, user_id)
    if cached_results:
        return {'results': cached_results, 'cached': True}  # ⚡ INSTANT
    
    # Only scrape if not cached (rare case)
    results = scrape_fresh_data(query)
    cache_results(query, results)
    return {'results': results, 'cached': False}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### **Preload Manager Features**
```python
class PreloadManager:
    def __init__(self):
        # Popular search terms for preloading
        self.popular_searches = [
            'one piece', 'naruto', 'dragon ball', 'bleach',
            'attack on titan', 'my hero academia', 'demon slayer'
        ]
        
        # Source-specific configurations
        self.source_configs = {
            'weebcentral': {
                'base_delay': 2.0,  # Respectful delays
                'crawl_delay': 1.0,  # From robots.txt
                'max_requests_per_hour': 100
            }
        }
```

### **Cache Manager Features**
```python
class CacheManager:
    def get_cached_search(self, query, source, user_id):
        # Check cache with user-specific and global options
        # Returns cached results if available
        
    def cache_search_results(self, query, source, results, user_id):
        # Cache results for future use
        # Supports both user-specific and global caching
```

### **API Integration**
```python
@app.route('/search', methods=['GET'])
def search_manga():
    # Check cache first (unless force refresh)
    if not force_refresh:
        cached_results = cache_manager.get_cached_search(query, source, user_id)
        if cached_results:
            return jsonify({'results': cached_results, 'cached': True})
    
    # Only scrape if not cached
    results = scrape_fresh_data(query)
    cache_manager.cache_search_results(query, source, results, user_id)
    return jsonify({'results': results, 'cached': False})
```

## 🎨 User Experience Impact

### **Before Preload**
```
User: "Let me search for Bleach..."
